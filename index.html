          <br />
          <p>
            Across the country, the prospect of home ownership is slipping out
            of reach for the ordinary buyer. Data from Redfin, Freddie Mac, and
            the Census Beureau show that a median-priced home in the U.S. is no
            longer affordable for a median-income household.

            With several underground pop artists breaking out into the
            mainstream, I collected data on five contemporary pop stars'
            discography, live shows, and listeners to show how the path to

            With extreme heat becoming an ever more common public health
            concern, the National Weather Service has begun publishing daily
            heat risk forcasts. I wrote a bash script to scrape each day's
            forcast and automatically update a choropleth map to display the

          <p>
            On August 9, 2014 Michael Brown Jr. was killed by police in
            Ferguson, Missouri, sparking nationwide protests against police
            brutality. In the 10 years since Brown's death, the number of people
            killed by police each year has not decreased and officers are no
            more likely to be prosecuted for on-duty killings.

          <p>
            A Gallup survey found that nearly 1 in 5 LGBTQ+ adults has not come
            out to their friends or family. However, if and when respondents
            came out changed depending on when the respondent was born. To
            illustrate this cohort effect, I used a small multiples bar chart.

            After plummeting during the coronavirus pandemic, air travel has
            rebounded and hit new highs. After scraping passenger screening data
            from the TSA website, I applied a 7-day rolling maximum as a way to
            smooth out weekly fluctuations without distorting the dates or
            values of record highs.

            The ammount of electricity generated from coal in the U.S. has
            steadily fallen since 2008. At the same time, the ammount generated
            from wind has grown, overtaking coal in March and April of this

            In 2023, Donald Trump was mentioned more than Joe Biden on CNN and
            MSNBC, but on Fox News this trend was reversed. I presented this
            finding in Columbia Journalism Review along with what it might mean

          <p>
            While city council and community board meetings are a valuable
            source of information about local issues, most reporters cannot
            attend every single one. To address this problem I developed an AI
            assistant to ingest council meeting transcripts, suggest story
            angles to pursue, and answer followup questions about what took
            place.
